# UFOs
## Overview of the analysis:
Using HTML, Javascript and Cascading Style Sheets, I was taked with creating a website that pulls data from a data from a file and organizes it on a table then filers the data by the date input by the user. I was then asked to add additional filter criteria so that the data could be more specifically filtered. I was asked to add city, state, country, and shape to our available filters. 

## Results:

In order to search (filter) information of the data on the site users are to select which search criteria they would like to use. Users are to fill in the text boxes with there search criteria and press the enter key.

The table then populates information based on the criteria the user input.

## Summary:

One rather large drawback to this page is that it is case sensitive in the search bar and does not leave suggestions. So for inputs for the user to match they need to be exact.

I would suggest to fix this issue as it is not user friendly and many users will run into errors due to this. Another issue is that the website information comes from a local data file and is not updated with new information thus it is static. It would be better to link this information with a database of upto date UFO sighting information so that the website stays current with new sighting information.
